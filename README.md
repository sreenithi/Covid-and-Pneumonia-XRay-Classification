*NOTE:* This file is a template that you can use to create the README for your project. The *TODO* comments below will highlight the information you should be sure to include.

# Your Project Title Here

*TODO:* Write a short introduction to your project.
The aim of this project is to classify Chest X-Ray images as whether they are positive for Covid-19, Viral Pneumonia or Normal (free of both diseases). Two types of classification was implemented using Microsoft Azure ML as follows:
 * The first is to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)on the dataset and use the HyperDrive feature of AzureML to find the optimal number of filters for each Conv2D layer of the model.
 * The second option was to use the AutoML feature of AzureML with DNN enabled to automatically train multiple classifier models on the data

## Project Set Up and Installation
*OPTIONAL:* If your project has any special installation steps, this is where you should put it. To turn this project into a professional portfolio project, you are encouraged to explain how to set up this project in AzureML.

## Dataset

### Overview
*TODO*: Explain about the data you are using and where you got it from.
The data used for this project is the [Covid-19 Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/pranavraikokte/covid19-image-dataset) from Kaggle. It is an image dataset with 3 classes for *Covid*, *Viral Pneumonia* and *Normal* chest x-rays. 

### Task
*TODO*: Explain the task you are going to be solving with this dataset and the features you will be using for it.

### Access
*TODO*: Explain how you are accessing the data in your workspace.

## Automated ML
*TODO*: Give an overview of the `automl` settings and configuration you used for this experiment

### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your automated ML model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search


### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Model Deployment
*TODO*: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
- A working model
- Demo of the deployed  model
- Demo of a sample request sent to the endpoint and its response

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
